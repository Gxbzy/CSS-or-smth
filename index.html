       <p>Tyler Gregory Okonma (born March 6, 1991), known professionally as Tyler, The Creator,<br> is an American rapper and record producer.[2] He has been cited as an influential figure in alternative<br> hip hop during the 2010s.[3][4][5][6]

        Okonma became well known in the late 2000s, when he emerged on the internet as the leader and<br> co-founder of the music collective Odd Future. Within the group, Okonma participated as a rapper, producer,<br> director and actor, releasing studio albums that he produced for its respective members. Okonma also performed on his sketch comedy show Loiter Squad (2012–2014).

        Along with his collaborations with the group, Okonma developed his solo career beginning with his<br> self-released debut album Bastard (2009). Bastard earned him recognition in the online music press as an <br>emerging artist from the indie music scene. His second album, Goblin (2011), brought him mainstream media exposure, aided by the popularity of the single "Yonkers" and its accompanying music video. During this period, Okonma faced controversy in the media for his horrorcore-influenced sound and his violent, transgressive lyrical content.

        After the release of his third album, Wolf (2013), Okonma began to separate himself from his horrorcore<br> productions, turning to more accessible sounds incoporating fusions of jazz, soul and R&B. In 2015,<br> Tyler released his fourth album, Cherry Bomb, which featured guest appearance from artists such as Lil Wayne and Kanye West. In 2017, Okonma released Flower Boy, followed by subsequent albums Igor (2019) and Call Me If You Get Lost (2021), all of which earned him widespread critical acclaim and commercial success, with the latter two albums debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and each winning Best Rap Album at the 2020 and 2022 Grammy Awards, respectively.[7] His eighth studio album, Chromakopia was released on October 28, 2024.
